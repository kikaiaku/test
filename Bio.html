    <P class="para">I am a student in UNCC bootcamp. I have been working with programming for 4 years now. I started out in c# while learning game development. 
        I currently work for Harris Teeter, and I have been there for 15 years. My current job title is assistant market manager, and I manage a small team of employees. 
          My goals with this class is to pursue a new career. I have had an interest in programming since i was a kid. 
          I am an artist in a variety of mediums, but i love to work in the 3D modeling.
        I make models and games in my spare time.
